    <p>With almost 4 years of software development experience, I would like to apply for a Fellow position to continue the work at CERN. I was recruited to CERN as PJAS in 2012 to the GS-AIS-EB (Electronic Business) section where I have had the chance to work on a few exciting projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I successfully lead a few of my own projects: Waiting List reservation for CERN Hotel, ECM system based on Alfresco solution for one of the CERN departments, where I went through the whole development process cycle;</li>
      <li> e-Personnel project - CMS system based on Alfresco with more than 50 000 documents for recruitment unit at CERN;</li>
      <li>EDH - Electronic Document Handling system in a team of 10 people. Here I had a big variety of tasks, from 3rd line support to development of new documents/business processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During my time at CERN I have had the opportunity to work with different teams (HR, CERN Hotel representatives, external consultants) as well as with different people in our section while implementing diverse projects together. Therefore, my focus is not only on my personal technical level improvement, but also on better understanding of business processes and needs of the whole team, and enhancing of communication skills.</p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time on independent study. During the last year, I launched the technical blog of mine, designed several widgets for open-source Linux window manager Awesome, deepened my knowledge of Java, Linux, Ruby, Python</p>
