career:
 - position: Alfresco Developer
   company: CERN
   dates: September 2014 - current
   summary: I take part in the development of business critical eFiles document management system based on open source solution - Alfresco – the market leader in records management. One of my projects is e-Personnel – CMS system. I work in a small team of three; development is performed using agile software development with Scrum. As an Alfresco developer I work on extending and customizing Alfresco, which is needed since out of the box solutions of Alfresco do not provide enough functionality for CERN needs. Through this project, I have learned business processes of other teams, as we constantly work with CERN HR team, developing the way to link their needs with technical abilities of Alfresco software.
   accomplishments:
    - accomplishment: Customization of server-side and client-side parts of Alfresco in correspondence to the organisation's internal processes and requirements.
    - accomplishment: Integrating Alfresco with AppDynamics - application performance management system. This project consisted of setting up the AppDynamics and development of the monitoring extensions in order to provide metrics.
