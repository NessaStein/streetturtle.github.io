description: I am big fan of Ubuntu, but I've never liked the Unity shell, so I was using a Gnome shell mostly. But recently I decided to switch to the Awesome window manager. I watched few videos of it and I quite liked the idea of being able to control size and number of windows per workspace. So I've installed it and here want to share some of my problems with solutions.

First of all you need to install it:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install awesome fonts-font-awesome awesome-extra
{% endhighlight basj %}

Then logout and login using Awesome wm. 

### Two monitors

I am using two monitors so first thing that I noticed is second monitor is not supported, it's just mirrored the first one.
